# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLTK
Twitter sentiment Analysis model which will help us to classify the emotions in tweets. In this project, I have used NLTK library for text preprocessing and Implemented this using Logistic Regression and SVM model.
Dataset link for this project : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
Steps involved in this Project are:
1) Import Necessary libraries
2) Read and Load the Dataset
3) Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
4) Data Preprocessing using NLTK
5) Splitting our data into Train and Test sets.
6) Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer
7) Function for Model Evaluation
8) Model Building - Using Logistic Regression and SVM
9) Model Evaluation - calculating the accuracy and confusion matrix
